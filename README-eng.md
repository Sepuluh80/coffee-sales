# COFFEE SALES
## coffee-sales

- The dataset contains fictional coffee sales data from 2019 to 2022, encompassing various coffee types and roasting levels. I plan to create a dashboard to streamline the analysis of sales data.  
- Consolidate all data into a single sheet by merging complete data from multiple sheets into one, specifically the "Orders" sheet, to simplify dashboard creation using VLOOKUP.  
- Generate charts to visualize the sales performance of each coffee type.  
- Include a timeline filter to analyze sales performance within specific time periods.  
- Incorporate filters for coffee types, coffee sizes, and loyal customers (loyalty card holders).  
- Create a sales chart to identify which countries demonstrate the highest sales performance.  
- Develop a "Top 5 Customers" chart to highlight and facilitate the rewarding of loyal customers.
